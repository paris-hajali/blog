This website serves as a digital repository for me to document what I am thinking, learning and building.   

I recently completed a master's in machine learning at the University of Cambridge, where I focused on [using language models to generate programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15500) using code-snippets provided in-context. Previously, I studied electrical engineering at UCLA.
